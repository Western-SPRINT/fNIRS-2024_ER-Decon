**Description:**

Scripts for running deconvolution and event-related averaging on fNIRS data. These scripts accompany the abstract "Two Human fNIRS Datasets Reveal the Benefits of Event-Related Designs and Deconvolution for fNIRS Research", which will be presented at the Society for fNIRS conference 2024. 

<br>

**Requirements:**

MATLAB (currently using 2022b) and AnalyzIR Toolbox.

Uses [this tool](https://github.com/BrainsCAN-fNIRS/fNIRS_Tools) to handle file io, but could easily be adapted for other organization schemes.
